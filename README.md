# MP3Join
An application to join multiple MP3 files together, with support for dynamic transcoding if one or more of the MP3 parts has a diffent bit rate, sample size or number of channels.

The application uses the ID3 library for tag handeling, and NAuduo and NAudio.Lame for all encoding and transcoding.

My motivation for writing this application was purely because I could not find any other Windows based tool that could join MP3 files of different bit rates or sample sizes.
